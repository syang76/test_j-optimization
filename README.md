# test_j-optimization
reduce the computational time of the c code test_j.c by making the computation or algorithm more efficient.  The optimized code is test_j_revised.c.  
The optimization includes:

1.	Move Constants Outside Function:
Constants like pi, g, and fptildemin are calculated only once before the loop, avoiding redundant calculations.
2.	Precompute Common Terms:
Inside the function function_j(), pow(fpt, aX), pow(fpt, gX), pow(fpt, saX), and pow(fpt, sbX) are calculated once and stored in variables (fpt_aX, fpt_gX, etc.) to avoid repeated calls to pow().
3.	Reduce Redundant Computations:
Computations like f / fp and sigma * fp are done once and stored in variables (f_over_fp and sigma_fp) to avoid recalculating them multiple times.
4.	Avoid Branching:
Simplified the branching logic for sigma by using a ternary operator (f <= fp) ? sigma_a : sigma_b, which helps avoid conditional overhead.
5.	Efficient Use of pow() and exp():
The function uses exp() and pow() sparingly, only where absolutely necessary.

Total running time on Mac M1: 112s compared to 156s for the original test_j.c

the gcov files generated by gcov profiling tools are also uploaded to the same repository of test_j-optimization.
